## About the Project

EVM Bytecodes Check is a specialized tool designed to analyze smart contracts on the EVM blockchain for duplicate bytecodes. By efficiently managing requests with rate limiting and leveraging a local SQLite database, it provides a robust solution for contract evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `sc_checker.js` file.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install sqlite3 ethers@5.7.2 fs-extra bottleneck progress
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a file named `addresses.txt` in the same folder as the script. Add the contract addresses you want to analyze, one address per line.
2. Create a `secrets.json` file in the same folder with your Ethereum provider endpoint and Etherscan API key. Example format:
   ```json
   {
     "providerEndpoint": "YOUR_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT",
     "ethApiKey": "YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"
   }
   ```
3. (Optional) Modify the `transactionEvalCount` variable in the script to set a custom threshold for the minimum transaction count required for evaluation. Only contracts with a transaction count higher than this value will be checked. Default value is 10.
4. Run the script to start the evaluation:
   ```bash
   node sc_checker.js
   ```

The script will read the contract addresses from the `addresses.txt` file, utilize the configurations from `secrets.json`, and evaluate the contracts based on the specified transaction count threshold, checking for duplicate bytecodes and providing progress updates.

## Features

- **Database Management**: Utilizes SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of bytecodes.
- **Rate Limiting**: Manages request rates to adhere to Etherscan API limits.
- **Etherscan Integration**: Fetches transactions and bytecodes from the Ethereum network using Etherscan.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling and logging.
